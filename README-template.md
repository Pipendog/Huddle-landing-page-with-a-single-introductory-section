## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned more about how to work on icon hover state. I was surprise to see that icon or images doesn't act the same as text when it comes to hover state. I am not 100% sure how it work yet but it was a big chanllenge for me to find out how to trigger the hover state for icons.

This right here was the result of all the research i did on that matter:

```css
.footer img:hover {
  filter: invert(44%) sepia(74%) saturate(1306%) hue-rotate(294deg)
    brightness(102%) contrast(102%);
}
```


### Useful resources

- [PX to REM Converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This helped me convert raw px into rem.
- [CSS filter generator to convert from black to target hex color](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This is an amazing tool to convert icon into different colors.
- [Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en). - This is a good tool to choose the right colors to match with the original project colors.
- [Mdn Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web). - Always a good site to find answers to basic and advanced references and all.
